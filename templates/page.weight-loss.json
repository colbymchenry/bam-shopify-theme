At Balanced Aesthetics Medspa, we use <strong>two JUVÉDERM® fillers<\/strong> to plump the lips: <strong>JUVÉDERM® Ultra XC<\/strong> and <strong>JUVÉDERM® Vollure™ XC<\/strong>. What’s the difference between them?<\/p><p>Both JUVÉDERM® Ultra XC and JUVÉDERM® Vollure™ are <strong>made up of hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules<\/strong> and contain lidocaine to make the injecting process as comfortable as possible. Their differences are subtle. <strong>Ultra XC<\/strong> is manufactured using the <strong>same molecular weight of HA molecules<\/strong> for a consistent, predictable gel perfect <strong>for beautifully enhanced lips <\/strong>and the correction of lines around the mouth. <strong>Vollure™<\/strong> is manufactured by cross-linking <strong>high-to-low molecular weights<\/strong> of HA molecules, allowing for more <strong>subtle lip enhancement<\/strong> for patients seeking a bit less drama in their pout. Changes to the lips require precision and artistry to avoid an over-filled appearance. Having both of these JUVÉDERM® fillers available gives Balanced Aesthetics Medspa everything we need to <strong>master your lip enhancement for natural and stunning results<\/strong>.<\/p>"

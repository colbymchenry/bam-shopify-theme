Our patients receive a highly effective <strong>skin tightening and microneedling combined treatment <\/strong>with minimal downtime, unlike your traditional microneedling service. It works by creating a series of tiny, controlled injuries on the skin’s surface to <strong>promote its natural healing response<\/strong>. Then, radiofrequency energy is delivered through these channels to precise depths within the skin, where it reacts to <strong>contract cells and stimulates collagen production<\/strong>. Our Fraxis PRO’s advanced bipolar RF energy coagulates tissue causing a hemostatic response to stimulate collagen remodeling. The ‘smooth motor’ tip reduces discomfort for the optimal patient experience. <strong>New skin cells replace the damaged cells<\/strong>, and new collagen fibers form to renew the skin at the cellular level for <strong>better support <\/strong>and a firmer, more youthful appearance.<\/p><p>RF Microneedling:<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Helps with treating acne<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Builds collagen<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Is proven to help treat hair loss<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Minimizes large pores<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Diminishes and minimizes hyperpigmentation (dark spots\/patches on your skin) from sun damage, hormonal changes, and environmental causes<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Tightens skin and improves elasticity<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Minimizes scars and stretch marks<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Shrinks enlarged pores<\/p>"

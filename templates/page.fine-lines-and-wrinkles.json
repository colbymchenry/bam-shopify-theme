It’s about <strong>keeping your skin healthy at every layer<\/strong>, and there are various treatments at Balanced Aesthetics that do just that.<\/p><p><em><strong>INJECTABLE TREATMENTS<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Sometimes, <strong>you’ve earned your lines and wrinkles through a full range of expressions<\/strong>, like smiles or frowns. When this happens, a neurotoxin such as  <a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/neurotoxins-and-dermal-fillers\/botox\/\"><strong>BOTOX®<\/strong><\/a> <strong>or <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/neurotoxins-and-dermal-fillers\/xeomin\/\"><strong>Xeomin®<\/strong><\/a> may be your solution. Neurotoxins <strong>pause muscle movement<\/strong> that contributes to creating lines and wrinkles, so your <strong>skin has time to heal<\/strong> and repair wrinkled skin. It’s a quick solution—taking about 1 week to become effective—and you can see genuine improvement for months to come.<\/p><p><strong>Some wrinkles are not caused by dynamic muscle movements made<\/strong> while expressing yourself. If you’ve <strong>lost facial volume<\/strong>, your skin may sag, revealing lines and wrinkles around your mouth or chin. This is where <strong>JUVÉDERM® <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/neurotoxins-and-dermal-fillers\/dermal-fillers\/\"><strong>dermal fillers<\/strong><\/a> shine. By <strong>restoring volume<\/strong> to the areas where you’ve lost it, we can <strong>tighten your skin and contour your face<\/strong> to the more rounded, youthful shape you once had. We have a line of JUVÉDERM® fillers to meet virtually any desired aesthetic result, and we have the expertise and talent to bring your goals to life.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/laser-genesis\/\"><em><strong>LASER GENESIS<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p><p>This treatment directs micro-pulses of laser energy to the dermis, where the building blocks of collagen reside. By stimulating deeper tissues with gentle laser energy, we can <strong>jumpstart the growth of new collagen fibers to<\/strong> firm up and tighten your skin. <strong>Existing fibers get repaired, and circulation is improved to keep your skin healthy and smooth<\/strong>.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/radio-frequency-microneedling\/\"><em><strong>RADIOFREQUENCY (RF) MICRONEEDLING<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p><p>Microneedling is a fantastic treatment for diminishing fine lines and wrinkles because it <strong>stimulates the skin to heal damaged cells through controlled micro-injuries<\/strong>. Adding radiofrequency (RF) energy to the mix prompts tissues in the dermis to <strong>rebuild, repair, and renew collagen fibers<\/strong>, so the wrinkles that heal from the treatment are erased.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/co2-skin-resurfacing-treatment\/\"><em><strong>CO2 SKIN RESURFACING<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p><p><strong>Sometimes, removing the topmost layer of the skin is necessary to get rid of damaged cells that<\/strong> dull and wrinkle your complexion. CO2 skin resurfacing does just that. By creating a controlled injury to the skin’s surface, followed by laser energy delivered to the dermal layer, we can <strong>boost skin’s tone and texture through healing and collagen production<\/strong>. CO2 skin resurfacing goes deeper than other laser treatments, so it’s <strong>rejuvenation at every layer<\/strong>. When your skin is healthy inside, it looks beautifully smooth and youthful on the outside.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/peels\/\"><em><strong>CHEMICAL PEELS<\/strong><\/em><\/a><\/p><p>The beauty of chemical peels is how customizable they are. <strong>There’s a formula for nearly every type of skin and sensitivity level<\/strong>. You can also do a series of milder peels to shorten recovery times and accumulate improvements over time, or you can choose to be more aggressive for more dramatic results after some recuperation. The acid formulas in your peel will <strong>remove damaged skin<\/strong> from your top layer and <strong>bring healing to the tissues that have caused fine lines and wrinkles<\/strong>. Your skin emerges fresh and rejuvenated with a youthful glow.<\/p>"

Think of your scalp like a fertile field. The better the soil, the more robust the plants are which grow from it. <strong>When your scalp is healthy<\/strong>, has good blood circulation, and the tissues are well-nourished, <strong>your hair has the best possible environment in which to thrive<\/strong>. PRP can bring back scalp and hair follicle health.<\/p><p>PRP contains growth factors, and when these are injected into your scalp, they recruit nearby <strong>stem cells<\/strong>. The stem cells “read” these growth factors and <strong>rush to heal the scalp<\/strong> as if it had been injured, increasing circulation, repairing damaged cells, <strong>and creating new cells and keratin<\/strong>, the basis of hair follicles. With this new tissue generation, your existing follicles become healthier, and the <strong>strands of hair thicken<\/strong>. Stem cells are also blanks that can copy the cellular structure of whatever the tissue most needs. They become keratin to create new follicles, leading to <strong>new hair growth<\/strong> in place of hairs already shed.<\/p>"

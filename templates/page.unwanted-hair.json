Not only does this <strong>reduce the number of sessions<\/strong> needed to remove unwanted hair altogether, but it also <strong>saves you time and money<\/strong>.<\/p><p>The laser’s energy <strong>targets the pigment in follicles<\/strong> during the active growth phase, which only about 30% of hair follicles are in at one time. That <strong>pigment absorbs the energy<\/strong> as heat, which damages the follicle beyond repair. The <strong>follicle<\/strong> <strong>breaks down<\/strong> to be shed by the body, after which point it is replaced by a dormant follicle becoming active.<\/p><p>Each subsequent laser hair removal treatment targets the newly active follicles, and after an <strong>average of 4-6 sessions<\/strong>, your treatment area becomes hair-free and smooth.

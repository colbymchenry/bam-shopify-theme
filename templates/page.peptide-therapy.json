CJC-1295 stimulates HGH secretion and can provide a steady increase of HGH with minimal effect on cortisol and prolactin levels. This means increased protein synthesis, thus <strong>promoting growth and fat loss simultaneously<\/strong>. Ipamorelin mimics ghrelin and binds to the ghrelin receptor (or GH secretagogue receptor, GHSR) in the brain, thereby selectively stimulating the release of GH from the pituitary gland. This results in increased plasma GH levels, which would affect many biological processes. Unlike other GH-releasing peptides, Ipamorelin only stimulates GH release in a manner very similar to that of Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone. This combination results in a <strong>great aid for sleep, energy, stamina, and recovery benefits<\/strong>.<\/p><p>Benefits include:<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Increased protein synthesis<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Promotes fat burning<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Improves sleep quality<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Increased bone density<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Accelerated injury recovery<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Improved immune system<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Increased protein synthesis<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Increased energy<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Increase in lean body mass<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p><strong>BOTOX®<\/strong> is derived from botulinum toxin Type A, a neurotoxin that <strong>interrupts the signals from your brain to your facial muscles<\/strong>, typically those of the forehead, between the brows, or around the eyes. When these muscles don’t move as much, <strong>your skin has a chance to repair the damage that causes wrinkles and lines<\/strong>. The overall effect is a younger, smoother appearance. The art of BOTOX® treatments is in the injection placement, and Balanced Aesthetics can <strong>erase your dynamic wrinkles<\/strong> without sacrificing the facial movements that let your personality shine.<\/p><p>BOTOX® Cosmetic:<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Corrects fine lines and wrinkles – primary indication for the forehead, frown lines, crows feet, lip flip<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Takes only 10-15 minutes for complete treatment<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Requires little to no downtime<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Produces within 3-5 days in most patients<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Reverses signs of aging<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Smooths skin<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>Having BOTOX® injections is no more painful than a <strong>typical pinch of a needle<\/strong>. We use <strong>ultra-thin needles and precise dosing <\/strong>to ensure you have as comfortable a treatment as possible. Our provider will thoroughly clean the treatment area(s) before injecting. Your BOTOX® session will take <strong>only 10-15 minutes<\/strong>, and you can return to your everyday schedule right away, though you should refrain from strenuous exercise, intense heat, or saunas for at least 12 hours post treatment.<\/p>"

Brow and eyelid drop is rare but may occur in some patients. Allergic reactions are also rare but may occur, causing itching, redness, rashes, and asthma symptoms. <strong>Most people feel none of this <\/strong>and only experience some mild injection site tenderness or headache.<\/p>"

This heat <strong>damages the hair follicles<\/strong> within the skin and delays (for long periods of time) or stops future hair growth. Only hair in the active growth phase can be treated. Once it is, dormant follicles transition into the active phase, at which point they can also be treated.

This removes the hair above the skin’s surface to prevent damage to the skin due to burnt hairs. Avoid aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs 8-hours before treatment. Do not pluck, wax, or have electrolysis done at least 3-4 weeks before treatment to avoid disturbing the hair follicle. Many patients report the sensation of the laser energy like that of a rubber band snapping against the skin.<\/p><p>Treatment number varies from patient to patient and depends on hair and skin pigmentation (color), but <strong>4-6 treatments are usually needed<\/strong> initially with possible low maintenance necessary yearly or bi-yearly.<\/p>"

This light is converted to heat, <strong>which breaks down these collections of pigment<\/strong> by damaging the integrity of these cells. Your body then absorbs them and filters them out naturally, leaving your complexion smoother, clearer, and with fewer pigment irregularities for an even tone. IPL therapy also diffuses redness and repairs blood vessels close to the surface.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/laser-genesis\/\"><strong>Laser Genesis <\/strong><\/a>– This non-ablative laser treatment <strong>diminishes age spots and sun damage, diffuses redness, and reduces the appearance of scars.<\/strong> Micro-pulses of energy stimulate collagen production and <strong>break up collections of melanin overproduction<\/strong> to lighten pigmentation irregularities and clear your skin’s tone. A series of treatments produces a cumulative improvement to your skin’s overall appearance, leaving a smooth, vibrant glow.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/co2-skin-resurfacing-treatment\/\"><strong>CO2 Skin Resurfacing<\/strong><\/a>– This therapy is fractional, meaning it <strong>treats portions of the skin<\/strong> with carefully controlled micro-injuries that jumpstart your body’s healing process. The matrix of tiny injuries only affects a fraction of the skin’s surface, leaving <strong>bridges between the channels to speed healing <\/strong>and reduce recovery times. The result is a <strong>reversal of age spots, sun damage, scars, and texture concerns<\/strong> by renewing these cells for healthier, more even, and brighter skin.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancedaestheticsmedspa.com\/aesthetic-treatments\/face\/peels\/\"><strong>Chemical Peels<\/strong><\/a> – A chemical peel aims to <strong>remove the upper layer of damaged skin cells<\/strong> to promote healing and cellular turnover for a renewed, bright complexion free of hyperpigmentation and sun damage. Chemical peels can be <strong>tailored to your specific skin’s condition<\/strong> and sensitivity, going as mild or aggressive as you choose. Some clients prefer a series of milder peels for less downtime and cumulative improvement after each treatment, while others opt for more dramatic results after an aggressive peel despite a few days of downtime.<\/p>"

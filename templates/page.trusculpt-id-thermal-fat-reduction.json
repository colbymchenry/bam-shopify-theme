Clinical studies show that, after a <strong>single treatment <\/strong>with truSculpt® iD, you <strong>can reduce your fat cells by up to 24% <\/strong>on average. With safety temperature regulation, truSculpt® iD ensures temperatures at the surface remain comfortable while the RF energy reaches therapeutic heat to disrupt fat cells. truSculpt® iD can <strong>treat clients who may not be candidates for other body contouring procedures <\/strong>for reasons such as treatment location, fat thickness, or skin type and laxity. Get the body you’ve always wanted with truSculpt® iD.<\/p>"

Treatment is fast, between <strong>15-30 minutes<\/strong>, depending on the size of your treatment area.

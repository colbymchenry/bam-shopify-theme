The body’s natural cellular filtering process absorbs the damaged cells and filters them through the lymphatic system. Studies have proven truSculpt® iD produces <strong>up to a 24% reduction of fat cells in the treated area<\/strong> after a single treatment. The RF energy has the added benefit of contracting cellular structures and improving collagen production, so as your fat cells are filtered away, your skin tightens and becomes firmer and more youthful. truSculpt® iD’s temperature control ensures safe, therapeutic heating levels of subcutaneous fat while maintaining comfortable surface temperatures. Now, you can shape your figure to reduce unwanted fat, so your clothes fit better, and you feel more confident in your own skin.<\/p><p><strong>truSculpt® flex <\/strong>brings power and strength to your muscles through Multi-Directional Stimulation (MDS). Low levels of energy go deep into the muscles to create high-intensity contractions. With three modes to replicate crunches, squats, or twisting exercises, your truSculpt® flex <strong>treatment is tailored to your shape<\/strong>, fitness level, and overall goals. These contractions can achieve up to 30% muscle mass increase on average for a more toned, sculpted physique. Your <strong>muscles don’t just look stronger; they <\/strong><em><strong>are <\/strong><\/em><strong>stronger<\/strong>, allowing you to up the intensity of your exercise or weight lifting regimen for continued, long-term results.<\/p>"

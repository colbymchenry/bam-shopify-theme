If there is an injury to your toes, they can be particularly susceptible. Covering the problem up with <strong>footwear can exacerbate the infection<\/strong> if not enough air circulation reaches your skin. This can lead to detachment from the nail bed, discomfort when walking, and it can spread to other nails.<\/p><p>Thankfully, laser fungus removal at Balanced Aesthetics can help. <strong>The laser energy passes harmlessly through the nail<\/strong> itself to reach the area where the fungus grows—beneath the nail, where it’s most difficult to reach. The fungus absorbs the energy, <strong>effectively killing it<\/strong> and preventing further spread.<\/p><p>Laser fungus removal has these benefits:<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Generally <strong>more effective <\/strong>than other options for treating fungus<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>The <strong>disappearance of yellow, white, or brown discoloration <\/strong>and flaky debris at the infected area<\/p><p><strong>• Nail reattachment <\/strong>to the nail bed (once healed and the fungus is completely gone)<\/p><p><strong>• Normal shape and texture <\/strong>of new nail—the disappearance of thickness, bumps, and abnormal nail shape<\/p><p><strong>• Sessions are quick <\/strong>and usually only take about 30 minutes to complete<\/p>"

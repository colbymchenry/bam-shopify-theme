            "answer": "<p>The <strong>acoustic energy of a shockwave<\/strong>, when delivered to myoskeletal tissues, <strong>can reduce the pain of injury and promote healing<\/strong>. The kinetic energy is created by compressed air and transferred through the Shockwave device’s applicator and into the treatment area.<\/p><p>Here’s how Shockwave works:<\/p><p><strong>• Increases blood flow <\/strong>through new blood vessel formation.<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Enhances inflammation to initiate tissue regeneration and healing, then reduces inflammation as healing takes over, <strong>halting the inflammatory process before it becomes chronic<\/strong>.<\/p><p><strong>• Stimulates collagen production<\/strong>. Collagen fibers are the body’s most supportive protein, vital to the strength and integrity of ligaments and tendons. <strong>More collagen brings steadier joint support<\/strong>.<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Dissolves calcified fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are responsible for collagen production, and when trauma occurs to a tendon, these structures can calcify in the micro-tears. <strong>Shockwave shatters the calcium buildup <\/strong>so the body can filter it out through the lymphatic system.<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Delivers pain management by regulating Substance P, a neurotransmitter to mediate pain. Substance P is associated with intense, persistent, and chronic pain, which it relays through the central nervous system. The less Substance P there is to relay pain messages, the less intense the pain becomes. <strong>Shockwave reduces the concentration of Substance P, resulting in pain relief<\/strong>.<\/p><p><strong>• <\/strong>Releases trigger points responsible for pain in the back, neck, shoulders, arms, and legs. Taut bands of muscle fibers become extremely contracted, cutting off their own blood supply. Waste products begin to accumulate, which irritates sensory nerves, resulting in more muscle contraction. It’s a cycle of pain called “metabolic crisis.” <strong>Shockwave releases these contractions, relaxing the trigger points <\/strong>so the normal blood supply can carry away waste products.<\/p>"

You’ll be given eye protection for safety. <strong>The treatment itself may cause a slight stinging sensation<\/strong>, but it is not significantly uncomfortable. Your treatment should last <strong>30 minutes <\/strong>depending on the size of your treatment area.<\/p><p><\/p><p>The number of required treatments varies from patient to patient based on unique skin composition and aesthetic goals. <strong>The majority of patients see results after their first treatment<\/strong>.
